Open Source Overview
============================
INFLO AMS consists of the source-code for the INFLO application used in the AMS Project (Analysis Modeling and Simulation Testbeds for DMA and ATDM Evaluation). INFLO stands for the Dynamic Mobility Application titled Intelligent Network Flow Optimization. The application included in this package includes both Speed Harmonization and Queue Warning and is previously developed as a package for INFLO-SIM. The INFLO-SIM application is designed to use vehicle and detector data from Vissim Microsimulation Testbeds. However, the application was then reconfigured for 64-bit newer machines and for newer version of Vissim (Vissim 7.0). The application in this repository uses COM-based commands scripted through Python 2.7 to interact between the application and simulation.
