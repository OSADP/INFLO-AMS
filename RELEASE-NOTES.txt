RELEASE-NOTES:
The code version available in this folder is similar to the codebase available as INFLO-SIM in OSADP which was developed by Texas Transportation Institute and Kittelson Associates.

Booz Allen made revisions to the code for the AMS Project and these changes are described below:
1. Ported INFLO from 32-bit to 64-bit libraries.
2. Removed bugs that prevented writing certain values to the Access Database.
3. Reconfigured Access Database to utilize values from Vissim 6/7.
4. Added a Master File to manage simulations and batch them using Vissim 6/7.
